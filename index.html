            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Terraform is an open-source Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. Instead of manually clicking through the AWS console, you can write code that describes your desired infrastructure, and Terraform will create, manage, and update it for you. This approach brings many benefits, including version control, reusability, and consistency.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                In this guide, we will walk through how to use Terraform to provision common AWS resources: S3 buckets, Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), and EC2 instances. Terraform can be used to manage a wide array of AWS services, including but not limited to:

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                AWS CloudFormation is Amazon's own Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service. It allows you to model your entire AWS infrastructure (compute, storage, database, networking, analytics, machine learning, etc.) in text files. CloudFormation templates are typically written in JSON or YAML.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                While both Terraform and CloudFormation are IaC tools, they have different philosophies:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 pl-4">
                <li>
                    **Scope:** CloudFormation is AWS-specific, meaning it can only manage AWS resources. Terraform is cloud-agnostic and can manage resources across multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) and on-premise infrastructure.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **State Management:** CloudFormation manages state internally within AWS. Terraform maintains its own state file, which maps real-world resources to your configuration.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Language:** CloudFormation uses JSON/YAML. Terraform uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), which is designed to be more human-readable and expressive.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Rollback:** CloudFormation has built-in rollback capabilities for failed deployments. Terraform requires manual intervention or custom scripting for complex rollbacks.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Many organizations use both tools, leveraging CloudFormation for AWS-native solutions and Terraform for multi-cloud or hybrid-cloud environments.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                You can view your CloudFormation stacks and their deployment status in the AWS CloudFormation console.

        <!-- AWS CDK Section -->
        <section id="cdk">
            <h2 class="section-title">AWS CDK</h2>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define your cloud application resources using familiar programming languages. It allows you to define your infrastructure in languages like TypeScript, Python, Java, C#, and Go, and then synthesize it into CloudFormation templates.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                CDK offers a higher level of abstraction compared to writing raw CloudFormation or even Terraform HCL. It's particularly appealing to developers who prefer to define their infrastructure using code constructs rather than declarative configuration files.
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 pl-4">
                <li>
                    **Abstraction:** CDK provides constructs that encapsulate cloud best practices and common patterns, allowing for more concise and reusable infrastructure definitions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **Language Choice:** Developers can use their preferred programming language, leveraging IDE features, testing frameworks, and package managers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    **CloudFormation Underneath:** While you write code in CDK, it ultimately generates CloudFormation templates, which are then deployed to AWS.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                Terraform and CDK serve similar goals (IaC) but approach them differently. Terraform uses a custom DSL (HCL) and manages its own state, while CDK uses general-purpose programming languages and synthesizes to CloudFormation. The choice often depends on team's existing skill sets and architectural preferences.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                While CDK itself doesn't have a console view, its deployments are managed via CloudFormation, which you can monitor in the CloudFormation console.

                Here are the fundamental Terraform commands you'll use to manage your infrastructure:
            </p>

            <h3 class="subsection-title"><code>terraform init</code></h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                This command initializes a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. It downloads necessary providers and modules. You should run this command when you first start working on a new Terraform project or when you add new providers/modules.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>terraform init</code></pre>

            <h3 class="subsection-title"><code>terraform plan</code></h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                The `terraform plan` command creates an execution plan. It shows you what Terraform will do (create, modify, or destroy resources) without actually making any changes to your infrastructure. This is crucial for reviewing changes before applying them.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>terraform plan</code></pre>
            </div>

            <h3 class="subsection-title"><code>terraform apply</code></h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                The `terraform apply` command executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan. It provisions or updates your infrastructure according to the configuration. You'll be prompted to confirm the changes before they are applied.
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
                <pre><code>terraform apply</code></pre>
            </div>

            <h3 class="subsection-title"><code>terraform destroy</code></h3>
            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                The `terraform destroy` command is used to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure. It's useful for cleaning up resources after testing or when a project is no longer needed. Use with extreme caution in production environments!
            </p>
            <div class="code-block">
